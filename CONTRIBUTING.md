# How to Contribute to Fapstats Translations

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Here’s how you can help:

## 1. Choose a Project

Decide which project you want to help translate:
- `fapstats-web`
- `fapstats-app`
- `fapstats-braincandy`

## 2. Find or Create Your Language File

- If your language file already exists, open it and add or improve translations.
- If it does not exist, create a new file following the existing naming conventions (e.g., `de.json` for German).

## 3. Translation Best Practices

- Translate only the text, not the keys or structure.
- Keep message references (e.g., `@:pages.index.title`) unchanged.  
  These are used to reference other translations within the file and must remain as they are.
- Keep placeholders (like `{username}`) intact.
- Use clear, concise, and neutral language.
- Avoid slang, jokes, or culturally specific references.
- Follow the original file format (usually JSON).

## 4. Submit Your Contribution

- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your translation.
- Commit your changes with a clear message.
- Open a Pull Request describing what you have translated or improved.

## 5. Get Recognized

All contributors will be listed by name on the Fapstats website as a thank you for your help.
